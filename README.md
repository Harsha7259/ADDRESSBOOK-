The Address Book Management System is a menu-driven C application that allows users to manage contacts efficiently.
It supports creating, searching, editing, deleting, listing contacts, and saving them to a file for persistence.
This project demonstrates strong fundamentals of C programming, including structures, pointers, file handling, and modular design.
✨ Features:
➕ Create new contacts
🔍 Search contacts by name
✏️ Edit existing contact details
❌ Delete contacts
📃 List all saved contacts
💾 Save contacts to a file before exit
📂 Load contacts when the program starts

🧠 Concepts Used:
Structures (struct)
Pointers and pointer-to-structures
Functions and modular programming
File handling (fopen, fread, fwrite)
String handling (strcmp, strcpy)
Input validation
Menu-driven programming.
